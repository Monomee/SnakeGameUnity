Hi, my nickname is Monome
Welcome to my game project, Snake Game!!

All assets and audio in the project are taken from the internet (may or may not be copyrighted), 
but are completely for learning purposes and improving programming skills, not for commercial purposes.

You can download "Game Play" file only and play for free! (Window supported) 
The other files are Unity files, including all assets, sounds and my processes :D

Maybe it's not perfect, but i'm happy because it is my first game :>

Hope you enjoy, All comments will be welcomed!
